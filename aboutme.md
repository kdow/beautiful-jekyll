## Work
My work experience includes data aggregation, administrative coordination, and technical support.

## Education
I graduated from UCLA with a BA in Linguistics and French. I've continued my
education through online learning platforms such as EdX, Lynda, Datacamp, and Udacity.

I recently completed Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program where I learned
the data analysis process of questioning, wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and
communicating data, including:

- Exploring data using R at multiple levels using appropriate visualizations,
acquiring statistical knowledge for summarizing data, and developing intuition
around a data set.

- Developing my data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning
data. Learning how to use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it
for deeper analysis.

- Applying optimal design methodologies in Tableau and data visualization
principles to the data analysis process. Learning how to use analysis and
visualizations to tell a story with data.
